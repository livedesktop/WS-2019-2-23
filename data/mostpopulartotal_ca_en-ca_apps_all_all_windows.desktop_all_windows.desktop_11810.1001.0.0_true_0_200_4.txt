Take them away from your photos with Inpaint! With few simple gestures you will get clear, spectacular pictures, just like you intended them to be. Inpaint's Magic Wand tool allows you to select unnecessary objects or persons on a photo in literally seconds, so all you have to do then is to let Inpaint do the rest.\r\n\r\nRemove any unwanted elements.\r\nAside from the information we truly want to see on our photographs, there are also many not so crucial for composition if not worse. These are camera date stamps, watermarks placed by various websites, and other objects we don't want to be on a picture. After all, if you gonna hang a photo on a wall, you want it to look eye-catching not due to various visual wreckage on it. So remove it with Inpaint! With simple and efficient tools you are able to remove any unwanted elements totally effortlessly.\r\n\r\nRemove objects from photos.\r\nThe devil is always in details. A tiny object on a photo can ruin the entire composition or even make it produce the effect opposite to that you initially were hoping for. Using Inpaint removing objects from photos is almost as easy as taking a shot itself. With merely three simple steps you can make power lines, tourists, buildings, background wreckage and other elements vanish as if they never were there.\r\n\r\nRepair old photos.\r\nOld doesn't always mean bad. Some older photos we have are still important to us as they still carry value and bring positive emotions. Alas, scratches, spots and tears are an inevitable legacy of the old film photography, especially if we talking about aged pictures. Happily the digital copy of a scanned old photo can be easily retouched with Inpaint. This little yet capable helper will make all those frustrating defects go away with minimum efforts from your side. Just select problematic zones on the picture and fix them!\r\n\r\nImprove your skin with Inpaint.\r\nNobody is ideal. Yet still we want to look better sometimes - retouch some wrinkles, remove skin defects. Indeed, what a wedding photo would bear redness or pimples on the bride's face? What about prom album or a dating site? Inpaint allows you to quickly improve your skin on photos and conceal everything you don't want to show. Just apply the Marker tool or the Magic Want tool to every problem zone and instantly see the difference!","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MVXFN1C2B2P","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"PDF Merge Tool","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40929.13850530198929950.f461d611-773b-4dd7-acc1-fe60173badb6.e4189a91-931b-413f-bf11-6d7889b152b3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#b1693c","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35033.13850530198929950.63bf9137-9cba-4dc2-97c1-1eef6a84d77f.61c6b978-8e8c-4513-9d99-c43ef6352ac2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#b1693c","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29964.13850530198929950.59f6ee24-81a7-4f9a-b2d7-e7fdd52cb4bf.22e66a27-8cad-4668-b6e0-610e14439a81","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#b1693c","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9527.13850530198929950.b22961a5-a7f7-4661-84ec-2a1c52d840ee.cd59ad5d-e4cc-40a0-b38b-62485abc52e3","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#b1693c","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12778.13850530198929950.ec8e772a-f82a-4b8e-9f52-035d884345ee.e41eb313-898e-4140-b5d2-a5915a279f31","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#b1693c","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57324.13850530198929950.65eadbac-24d4-4821-bd9e-0fdb1be1a2b1.44d36221-ca1c-4661-a2df-11ffc7fc59f7","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#b1693c","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49087.13850530198929950.55e6b3eb-e66b-4c7a-b1e4-b0884e163beb.4757e76b-2f26-47f5-bcca-65f8ab667837","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"CAD $10.29","DisplayPrice":"CAD $5.29","Price":5.29,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"7","PackageFamilyNames":["Roxy.PDFMergeTool_ewf963ntvtz24"],"ContentIds":["7766776f-5d33-d4dd-95b4-219c97e0cf25","c733fd8f-962a-31f2-eef7-ccf7f3731b54"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"SAVE CAD $5.00","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"PDF Merge Tool allows you to easily and quickly merge multiple files with different formats in a single PDF file.

He must play either the next card in sequential order or a wild '*' card, using either cards in hand, the top card of his stock pile, or the top card of any of his four discard piles. If the player can play all five cards from hand, he draws five more and continues playing. When no more plays are available, the player discards one card to either an empty discard pile or on top of an existing one and play passes to the next player. When a build pile reaches 12, it is removed from the board and that space becomes empty for another pile to be started; play continues until one player has played his final start card.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NT5TW52F7GJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"BOX GAMES","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43392.14424501316211023.d30cff35-b076-478c-a12b-0b5a434d1be6.e83435ef-38fb-4f40-8af6-8ca5904cae7c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7848.14424501316211023.d30cff35-b076-478c-a12b-0b5a434d1be6.ba6a00ff-746b-4c34-9daa-021c25a97f74","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["35380TelltaleTech.BOXGAMES_7e08s3c0n72hg"],"ContentIds":["57625420-deea-e767-a2b7-6a6f89d3e9f5","ad4ca32a-410c-ad58-7634-97795683dac1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"《BOX GAMES》is a great game collection app. The app contains all kinds of game collections you want to play, so you don't have to worry about playing any more.

Vince’s adventure takes him from the streets of New Orleans to the depths of a Louisiana bayou to find the whereabouts of his keeper, Madam Charmaine.\r\n\r\nIn true voodoo style, Vince encounters and defeats quirky monsters and villains ... by kicking his own butt! By racing under a falling safe, jumping into a high-speed blender, or leaping under falling rubble, Vince is sure to defeat his enemies—all while managing to escape completely unscathed.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n• Voodoo combat action: Players can employ more than 30 voodoo attacks that do outrageous things to Vince, but it's the monsters who end up hurting! Unlike in other games, players must actually USE dangers and hazards, instead of running from them. Falling safes, prickly pushpins, and bolts of lightning bring a whole new meaning to the phrase \"no pain, no gain.\" \r\n\r\n• Magical voodoo world: Thrust into the depths of a twisted and dangerous world, Vince must trek through 30 detailed levels, including crawfish-laden swamps, a graveyard filled with imps and lost zombies, a fantastic French Quarter, and a network of boggy sewers. \r\n\r\n• Vehicles and minigames: As the game unfolds, Vince must master and pilot a number of vehicles, including a fanboat, a submarine, an airplane—and even a rat gives him a lift at one point. Vince must master one mind-bending minigame after another to complete his quest. \r\n\r\n• Dynamic cast of characters: No adventure would be complete without its host of surly characters. Offbeat creatures with all the charm of New Orleans are around every corner. Vince encounters everything from Ginger Dead Men (who are not exactly sugar-coated) to a pair of intoxicated gas pumps that offer up a fiery challenge.\r\n\r\nSupports Xbox Play Anywhere: yours to play on both Xbox One and Windows 10 PC at no additional cost.\r\n\r\nSupports Xbox Live features including earning achievements and sharing game clips.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZMQSP","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Font Candy - Typography Photo Editor","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.12960.13510798883392466.cd9cffb5-1fc7-49d4-9b4b-25b7364e9da9.2a7075ee-124f-40e9-b9e2-429c82c73f1b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#212121","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.46743.13510798883392466.bf13297d-3a70-4f92-add5-d4ad9e447329.6fc3cef4-6159-4867-9098-30c3e77538f9","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#212121","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.17882.13510798883392466.7841aa72-40ed-484b-a496-aa196b45923f.20d5ea97-d828-4073-97ff-d26593e637e8","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#212121","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.60381.13510798883392466.2356cfc0-6d8b-43f5-9be3-50f89d9c2f93.fec2376d-c8a5-46e4-8010-da83589dfe4e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#212121","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.23905.13510798883392466.27d26726-35b7-4adb-b312-9565997d7f38.c29e7d06-5eee-4ea1-bb2f-703b358a4335","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#212121","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.5,"RatingsCount":"26","PackageFamilyNames":["EasyTigerApps.FontCandy_dgwy3a3h02hc6"],"ContentIds":["81c81ddc-5a9f-d97b-b9b0-2b9e42c07855","eec94229-3048-c651-3f23-cc7d31e88204"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Easy Tiger, the creators of Split Pic, are happy to announce that Font Candy is now also available on Window!

The app natively supports all kinds of input devices: stylus, touch, mouse and keyboard.\r\n\r\n• Nondestructive Boolean operations.\r\nYou can edit parts later, switch Boolean effect off and on from the Layers panel, or convert result into editable curves at any moment\r\n\r\n• Simple – easy to learn, easy to use. \r\nMinimum tools, concepts and controls - just enough to get your design job done. Instead of trying to invent another all-in-one Swiss-army-knife drawing tool we removed everything that can prevent you from creating clean vector shapes.\r\n\r\n•       Noise free UI. \r\nNothing should stay between you and your work. We believe that all you need to be creative is a pen and a sheet of paper; UI should be hidden until you really need it. The screen space is super valuable on tablets and ultrabooks, so we put absolute minimum of UI control elements on the screen. \r\n\r\n• Set of nondestructive smart shapes such as star, gear etc.  \r\nYou can change shape settings at any moment by using smart handlers or convert to editable curves when you need it.\r\n \r\n• State-of-the-art drawing and graphics editing capabilities. \r\nUnlimited undo\\redo, move, resize, rotate, skew, grouping, layers. Linear, radial and image fills, opacity, opacity masks, shadow effects. Powerful spline shapes editor– everything you expect from vector graphics.\r\n\r\n• Really affordable. \r\nNo subscriptions, no hidden fees: basic edition is free to use, premium features can be enabled by one-time in-app purchase. You can use purchased edition on multiple systems without any additional fees.\r\n\r\n• Modern drawing engine under the hood. \r\nFast drawing engine based on the latest version of Microsoft Win2d technology.\r\n\r\n• Hand-draw shapes recognition. \r\nFast shape recognition system – draw commonly used shapes with a pen.\r\n\r\n• Html5 ready. \r\nHi-quality SVG export and import.
