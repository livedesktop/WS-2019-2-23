We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too.

Stress Management and Relaxation contains two guided relaxation techniques to guide you through the process of becoming more fully relaxed as well as useful tips for reducing stress. Some people find these techniques helpful for getting to sleep at night. As a clinical psychologist and app developer, I wanted to combine the two skills to write an app that may be of benefit to many.  The world is a stressful place, and one component of coping with that stress is learning how to more fully relax.  I have included two relaxation strategies that I frequently use with my psychotherapy clients.  Two relaxation techniques are included along with a peaceful and relaxing background music.  1. Relax and Breathe - Walks you through relaxing all the muscles in your body combined with a deep breathing exercise. (7 minutes and 40 seconds). 2. Relax and Visualize - This technique is a mildly self-hypnotic procedure that includes relaxing your muscles, mind, and visualizing a peaceful scene.  This is often a favorite (15 minutes).  I include two techniques, because some people find they can more effectively utilize one technique over the other.  Also, having one with a shorter play time helps when you need to relax, but are under time pressure.  Enjoy, and I hope this brings you a little peace in a hectic world.  \r\n\r\nNote: These techniques are not intended to treat any emotional or physical condition.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMKRH","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"All About Physics","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15134.9007199266453610.8d824aba-33bd-4bba-bb89-00f467bde035.ff1c7061-8667-4e75-9a8d-97ac86b47caa","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#008000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55780.9007199266453610.d9920450-a0d5-4c75-b514-7eaa1172fb7c.66570734-3a0d-4657-a3cf-0a47ad86d780","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#008000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["4816Jim5975.AllAboutPhysics_2p4qhtsbtt4qy"],"ContentIds":["68934715-ea8d-ef34-037d-5b10b2c9b1df"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"All About Physics will help you solve complicated Physics problems with just a few clicks.

Starting on the second day, your recent items are suggested because you may eat the same food frequently.\n3. Logging in is not needed: No personal data or contact information is required.\n4. Thousands of items already in the database: Most food items have accurate information about common serving sizes, calories, carbohydrates, protein and fat. \n5. Full off-line support: No need to be connected to the internet. \n6. Precise entry is also easy: You can accurately enter the precise amount using a slider.\n7. Daily reports: Using the menu, you can directly open the diary, which shows a summary of your day. Here you can switch between calories, protein and carbohydrates by pressing on little triangle.\n8.

Personal reminders help you stay on target: They are a convenient way to make sure you fill out your diary, after each meal, or at the end of the day.\n\nIt is a good idea to verify the information in the database is the same as the information on your food packaging; food nutrition fluctuates with brands and over time.\n\nMake sure to discuss your goals with your doctor or nutrition specialist.\n\nPREMIUM FEATURES:\n1. No more advertisement.\n2. A much larger food database.\n3. The ability to e-mail yourself a copy of the diary.\n4.
