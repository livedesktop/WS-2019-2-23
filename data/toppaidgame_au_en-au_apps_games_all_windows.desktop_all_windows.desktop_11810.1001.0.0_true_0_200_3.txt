These words have been compiled from numerous sight word lists provided by real 1st grade classes in different schools. Help your kid learn and retain several words while having fun! \r\n\r\n√ 200 different sight words \r\n√ 10 words to find per puzzle \r\n√ Customizable letter and background colors \r\n√ Nice colorful high definition graphics \r\n\r\nSimply slide your finger across the letters to form a word that's displayed on the left side of the screen. The words are in the word search vertically, horizontally, and diagonally. All of the words are displayed in a forward facing manner. Have fun! \r\n\r\n(Sight words are commonly used words that children are encouraged to memorize as a whole by sight, so that they can automatically recognize these words when they see them without having to use any distracting strategies. Sight words account for a large percentage of the words used in literature for children. One advantage for children being able to recognize sight words automatically is that the child will be able to identify the majority of words in a book before they even attempt to read it. When the child is able to do that they'll be able to concentrate on the meaning and comprehension as they read without having to stop to figure out the actual word.)","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDSHWQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kids learn about Nature - Flashcards for Toddlers","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19285.9007199266578619.066feac2-8a35-4985-b81e-5c40fdfb0062.80600b9f-a099-4d3d-beb1-4a287e1eb597","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#00D900","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2656.9007199266578619.b48bd281-adee-407d-895d-a9708ac01070.65fa4bd2-0dc3-427c-8a8e-7c8c77212b3b","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#00D900","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64216.9007199266578619.f20e51c2-577c-4993-b47f-bc31486af6cb.e4c6490a-9c48-4422-b02b-1d61103d5dfd","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#00D900","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5145.9007199266578619.51e1093e-8b97-46d6-a10e-cd8fa36ad9e1.fd8fb6db-3564-437e-849c-dd8ee48c7e9f","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#00D900","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26900.9007199266578619.4ae2605b-7082-41b8-ace8-014724a0eb73.470acba3-521d-49a3-8be5-1fa02c049191","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#00D900","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57113.9007199266578619.38960c33-88a1-4332-9bd4-670995c3dc4f.99e83d68-45f4-4d07-b20a-1decf5dfc4ca","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#00D900","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23374.9007199266578619.e234dd76-f987-48bb-8195-2d6fb3ebdc5f.fcf90118-72f9-4aab-b051-037ed4ae4474","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#00D900","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$2.95","Price":2.95,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["32004CLEVERBIT.46743931995EE_krxe918j0j7ce"],"ContentIds":["ff2759d6-485a-2a6e-39c2-cb8e554a9111","dad1fe56-576b-c649-02b8-dca6fe892a44","b91446cb-e201-e608-1d9c-ffb58b7bab37"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"“Nature for Kids,” from the series “Words for Kids,” is a game that promotes the development of children between 2 and 4 years of age.\r\n\r\nTogether with your child, you can watch wonderful images of natural objects and phenomena, seasons, fruits and vegetables, berries, flowers, and mushrooms, all while learning their names! \r\n\r\nThe carefully selected photographs will not only help a child learn the names of various natural objects and phenomena, but also expose him or her to the remarkable beauty of the world in which we live!\r\n\r\nAfter the child has looked through all the flashcards, he or she can take a fun quiz to see how many of the words he or she knows. Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child's developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThe educational flashcards for tots are divided into the following categories: berries, fruits, vegetables, flowers, mushrooms, the environment (sea, island, forest, river, mountain, etc.), the seasons, and natural phenomena (rain, rainbow, sunset, lightning, etc.). \r\n\r\nOne important feature makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify, the child will see beautiful, colorful photographs of each object and phenomenon. \r\n\r\nClearly, it is not so easy to show real live lightning, rainbow or erupting volcano to a child. This educational app allows the child to “see” many natural objects and phenomena as they appear in reality, while allowing parents to tell the child more about them. \r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! Besides English, this app also supports the German, Russian and Ukrainian languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their foreign language teachers and classmates. An A+ is sure to follow! \r\n\r\nIn order to use this educational app, the youngster does not need to be able to read. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently!\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDX2JN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"i Fishing","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61503.9007199266683355.eba36368-49fe-4717-ac14-3e423cb643f9.ad2d7939-f4d8-496b-ac99-782b15020f13","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#134680","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.107.9007199266683355.6b2066a5-60ad-48d6-b2eb-4c76762718fe.b92f423b-132b-4ce5-b901-f069ed43461c","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#134680","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$4.45","Price":4.45,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["2495RockingPocketGames.iFishing_rbwbddbvdwtdj"],"ContentIds":["06a0ba0c-2b81-1d50-578d-23b6c3abbfd1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Welcome to iFishing, a fishing simulator by Rocking Pocket Games.  iFishing gives you a realistic fishing experience on the desktop and Windows 8 tablets.\r\n\r\nIn iFishing, location, lure, lure depth, jigging and your reeling speed makes a difference about what fish you catch.

Wield magic cards instead of weapons and slay the armies of darkness in the dungeons below the Old Cathedral. Save the terror-stricken Paperverse from the clutches of the Archdemon himself! \r\n\r\nCARDS AND DECKBUILDING\r\nIt’s not a card game, but items, spells, and skills are all expressed as cards. The strategy lies in adapting your hand to each situation. Cards can be upgraded with runes and you can find many variants with diverse bonuses. Legendaries are the most epic but hard to acquire.\r\n\r\nTAILORED SESSIONS WITH FLEXISCOPE\r\nBook of Demons respects your time. It features the Flexiscope engine which allows you to divide the game into sessions of any size. It even learns your pace of gaming and predicts the time to complete the next session.\r\n\r\nUNIQUE MECHANICS\r\nSimplified movement and fight mechanics is where Book of Demons differs the most from other hack & slash games. There is often not enough time to click-remove all of the obstacles such as monster shields, enemy spells, poison, or knocked cards, so timing, card selection and order of execution are critical.\r\n\r\nHACK & SLASH IN THE WORLD OF PAPERVERSE\r\nBook of Demons takes place in Paperverse, a world that exists entirely inside a pop-up book. It’s a tale of good and evil about saving the world from the ultimate devilry. Sounds familiar? Inspired by the dark and gloomy atmosphere of the first Diablo game, Book of Demons is part tribute part parody of hack & slash classics.\r\n\r\nCOMFORT OF GAMEPLAY\r\nMany Book of Demons features were designed with gameplay comfort in mind. Points of interest are marked at the top of the screen and get revealed once you get closer. Your character leaves footprints, which can be used to track your way back or notice paths already visited without opening the map.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGING ENDGAME\r\nOn average it takes about 10 hours to complete the campaign with a single class, but maxing out a character and mastering all of the higher Freeplay difficulty levels and Quests takes much longer. The Roguelike mode offers another level of challenge with permadeath, restricted healing and even more obstacles to overcome.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4RJ04","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Planet Genesis","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49697.13510798887415179.3de04683-b32d-4c5e-89d0-8b644f28c46f.19321d49-db3e-4c45-9c2d-e1dd96e5d3a7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5176.13510798887415179.da7db781-9e9d-49ce-8462-6e84a6566e3a.db84766f-346f-487b-a5b0-fd4b43be3652","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26899.13510798887415179.82a50537-f216-46aa-a51c-7e28bf121254.5f8b00d2-e1c8-429b-9c2e-4df04ff18c11","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7262.13510798887415179.295a0534-0d5b-440b-99ec-d901b7de5c24.7a4b052e-b76e-4867-a79e-6309e5ff1d92","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56888.13510798887415179.6eb68e11-e64c-4565-96fe-9d3fdfee52e2.9676cfba-8024-40d1-a491-bce7b0b226bd","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62291.13510798887415179.009872b2-04d3-46b6-b68e-a5631de056b6.c01ac081-ffe1-4c6f-9917-22f2e2a509a7","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50821.13510798887415179.bb564dc1-9d0e-4c8a-8c6d-512f43dd0927.49d2f367-ef2f-4290-9a95-228e7f0edcaa","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21950.13510798887415179.23695abc-d0c7-472a-b12c-9f0b2552cc8f.5cfabaff-a45a-43f0-9c94-fd0c6f768096","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24200.13510798887415179.db060858-f3ea-4fb0-a97c-18ddc6a371c0.1cd00a95-a42a-48d1-8bf9-726ea1e62c7d","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63589.13510798887415179.152512b8-fd69-4825-a99a-0efd08c784f5.e3a7d5a7-4c6e-40bd-989e-44a03e164eec","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$2.25","Price":2.25,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["63289RaptorClawEntertainm.PlanetGenesis_m35xss3rs3j1w"],"ContentIds":["14ff1925-b3e0-7b6d-cd59-79a0f7e8466f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Planet Genesis is one of the finest and most visually stunning universe sandboxes available for Windows devices.

With an endless gameplay, Floaties will keep you hooked as you travel 8 different worlds filled with specific obstacles. All you have to do is tap to keep the characters floating, but the easy controls are balanced by an almost impossible gameplay. Dare to take this challenge?\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\n✔ Endless Floating Gameplay. Control up to 4 “floaties” at the same time each with its own color by simply tapping to help them float. Each floatie is immune to the same color obstacles but is destroyed instantly by obstacles with other colors. Your main goal is to have a fleet of all colors and to try surviving the longest. Easy to play, but impossible to survive for long!\r\n\r\n✔ 8 Adventurous Worlds. Help your floaties survive through the ancient world of Egypt, the sci-fi landscape of the Moon, the unlawful Wild Wild West, the dangerous Jurassic Park and more. Each of the 8 playable worlds feature its own particularities depicted in eye-catching 3D graphics so get ready to dodge out-of-orbit satellites on the Moon, T-Rex bones in Jurassic Park and hundreds others!\r\n\r\n✔ Dozens of Characters. From flying drones, chicken, rockets to E.T., Cleopatra or even Jack the pirate you can unlock more than 40 different fun characters. Collect coins throughout the game and use those to spin the wheel of fortune to get a new random character or unlock your favorite one. Gain experience with each character and level them up to 5 stars!\r\n\r\n✔ Powerups and abilities. Aside coins you can collect special objects that help you gain powerups for a limited time (i.e. collect 4 potion bottles to double your coin collection for 15 seconds). With your new abilities you’ll survive longer and score higher. \r\n\r\n✔ Solve Quests. Each world has a theoretically endless flying/floating gameplay, although in reality you die A LOT, but offers side quests too. Can you collect 7 items of the same color? Or have one of RGBY floatie destroyed a couple of times? The more quests you solve, the tougher that level gets. You start at Easy, advance to Medium and become a master when you reach the Hard level of difficulty.\r\n\r\n✔ Achievements & Leaderboards. Connect via Google Play Services to unlock more achievements and access the social or global leaderboards if your score is high enough. You’ll also be able to analyze the statistics for each world, such as how many items you’ve collected, how many quests you’ve completed, what was the best score and MUCH MORE!\r\n\r\n✔ Multiplayer Challenges. Provoke up to 4 of your friends to a game of keeping floating characters alive! You can play the game in multiplayer mode and this gives 4 users the chance to play Floaties on the same device. Who can be the best? Only practice will tell!\r\n\r\nAside surviving all sorts of entrapments that destroy Floaties of a different color (i.e. than the obstacle color) you must collect coins, power-ups and character resurrection items. Play often and you will be able to get free coins too by pulling the handle of a slot machine. The same game will unlock a random character for 100 coins.\r\n\r\nEach world you play in features awesome 3D graphics and well designed characters that create a great gaming experience especially accompanied by an entertaining soundtrack and sounds.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU for downloading, playing and rating Floaties!

It's also a great way for grownups to clear one's mind, or get into that trance or meditative state when thoughts can ramble around as they want.  \r\nYou can play Wall Ball in standard mode, with a pretty fast ball, or in easy mode with a rather large and slower moving ball, or you can even play in seated mode, suitable for people with some physical impairment or if you just feel very tired.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL STUFF:\r\nBefore starting the game, Make sure you have the Kinect camera (sensor) properly installed on your computer. Follow instructions from Microsoft website to install Kinect and the necessary SDK software  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561 \r\nTo use Kinect for Xbox One on your computer, you need the Kinect Adapter for Windows. After installation of the Kinect software you should be able to see the Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0 in your app menu. \r\nFind a good spot to play where the Kinect camera can view you from head to feet. You can easily check this with the software that follows with the installation of the Kinect SDK software. You can for instance run Kinect Studio v2.0 (under Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0) to view yourself in front of the Kinect.\r\nIf everything looks ok, then you can start the Wall Ball game.\r\nIt can be recommended to connect your computer to a larger monitor or TV screen (using a HDMI cable) to  improve the \"feel\" of the game and making it easier to see.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\n•\tFree the space around you to not hurt yourself or to break any furniture. (Think about arms could be waving upwards too.)\r\n•\tIf children are playing they should be supervised and instructed by parents to not hurt themselves bumping into furniture.\r\n•\tIf other people are present in the room, make sure they are not in front of the camera and that they are at a safe distance from you bumping in to them.\r\n•\tIf you experience problem with balance, consider sitting down when playing.\r\n\r\nQUICK START\r\nBefore you start, make sure Kinect is properly installed and you have tested a good spot for playing where the Kinect sensor can \"read\" you properly, see above under \"Technical stuff\". If you have two graphic cards on your system, run the game with the better card otherwise it can affect Kinect/game performance. (For example, if you have a nvidia card you can manage this in nvidia control panel, manage 3D settings.)\r\nStart the game by pressing the Wall Ball icon.\r\nFrom the Main Menu (start screen), choose one of the three game variants Standard or Easy version or if you would like to sit down and play, choose Seated mode. The ball is somewhat larger and slower in Easy and Seated mode.\r\nWith the Toggle Show Settings (down at the right corner), you can adjust for your camera's placement above the floor. It is recommended to fine tune this. If the camera height setting are too low, you will feel like your feet are really heavy and won't lift properly. If it's to high, your feet will float in the air. The camera height slider correspond to the Kinect sensor's placement above the floor, however if it is tilted, you may have to adjust the slider more.\r\nStand in front of the Kinect camera, let the camera know you're there by moving slightly. When camera has found you, start kicking.\r\nKick the ball by using your right or left foot. When aiming, remember this is virtual reality so aim in a real world scale, not just in a small tv screen scale, that is, play like you were in the park yourself facing a large wall about 4 meters in front of you.\r\nIf the ball touches the area right behind you (an area as wide as the yellow area you're standing on) you will lose one ball. \r\nTo prevent the ball from hitting this area, you can stop the ball with your \"body\", shown as a silhouette, or just use your feet. You can slide from side to side inside the yellow area and crunch (you can't really move forward or backward, only as far as your legs can reach).\r\n\r\nIf you have lost all of your five balls, the game will end and you can choose to save, restart or exit. You choose between alternatives by putting your foot in one of the boxes, in this way you can restart instantly if you would like without the need to reach for the computer. You can also click on the signs with the mouse. From the Start screen, you can click on Result Menu where you can view your results.\r\n\r\nVideo tutorial: https://youtu.be/qFTv-q2cccg\r\nPDF tutorial: http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5QTX7","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Snooker 8 Ball / 9 Ball","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22077.13510798887295764.4735b45d-1175-4136-8e96-f45201ad1264.1d0c03a0-9092-4869-8158-17c6eaf593b5","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1350.13510798887295764.402197bf-a5d0-4b0b-a6a3-d5763a6d54ac.7df53a94-d9af-45b4-b43c-ad7ed74edc7d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$2.95","Price":2.95,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["2654JieDongLLC.PoolBilliards_qy8nsd7yxg59e"],"ContentIds":["eeadc4c9-0cfc-cace-97d3-e82747bd9661"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"9 ball pool billiards game!  \r\n\r\nShoot and pot as many balls as you can before the time runs out in this 9 ball billiards game.

Math is fun! \r\n- Since it introduces characters from Greek mythology and provides basic knowledge about them, it can be put together with games for kids between first and 4th grade\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\nThe game itself is based on numbers:\r\n- 7 to 14 (1st to 8th grade) is the age for which this game was designed\r\n- 12 characters from Greek mythology included in the game: Zeus and Athens as heroes, and Hades, Chimera, Medusa, Giant, Titan, Minotaur, Centaur, Cerberus, Typhon and Satyr as the bad guys.\r\n- 50 levels you have to complete\r\n- 3 difficulty levels (easy, normal and hard)\r\n- 0 to 1000 is the range of numbers for calculation tasks\r\n- 4 math operations - multiplication, division, addition and subtraction\r\n- 10 bosses to defeat.

You wish you did not have to go outside, but you do. It would be easier to give up. But you don’t. The hardship, the hunger, the thirst. The fear. You keep reminding yourself why you stay alive. Why you do this. Then you hear it. “Daddy you’re back.” You wife’s face lights up and you open a bag full of medical supplies. You need not tell her how you got them. You simply enjoy your small victory in this, the harshest of times. In the post-apocalyptic world, you must keep your family alive in your underground bunker in this deep strategy game from Unicube...\r\n\r\nSheltered is a post-apocalyptic disaster management game that gives a whole new meaning to the term “nuclear family”. Given a head-start over the billions lost in a nuclear holocaust, you must gather as many supplies as possible en route to the concrete underground shelter that will soon become your family home for the foreseeable dreary future.\r\n\r\nWith all hope lost, how will you cope in this bleak new world? How you handle the many moral choices you'll encounter on a daily basis could be the difference between your family surviving or dying. Combat claustrophobia, radiation and mental exhaustion as you cling desperately to life in the cramp, cold and scary underground shelter. You’ll have to leave the scant protection the shelter offers behind as you’re forced to venture outside into the dangerous desolate wasteland to scavenge for vital supplies which could ensure your families survival for just one more day.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6J1BW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Game Arcade for Cats","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14985.13510798886735404.5597af0f-20e8-4343-b6e8-7276605ceefd.10da9715-c677-4efd-abeb-1cf5125ce20a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39381.13510798886735404.80994ceb-77d5-40b5-b502-776da79069e0.50edf31b-1e5b-4d09-878a-1a1705997cab","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52017.13510798886735404.2c478896-c3bf-42d3-9657-7c67e1d152e4.78dd20ea-8d93-4e3f-bf92-4c57b646e5a8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31667.13510798886735404.adbdae94-e184-4005-96f6-0033a0459a95.62a92869-3905-44cc-a553-867d2851ca8e","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36782.13510798886735404.470393e6-ce95-4470-b28c-ed34cd95fe77.3e257798-6d7e-45ff-a9a2-168a2e637821","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$2.95","Price":2.95,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["34088MightyBeaverStudios.GameArcadeforCats_0jg71q3ssj684"],"ContentIds":["d219d009-1ec4-3b41-84a1-d9484768e2be","f0748b7f-16df-7504-f95b-63dec3173e59"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Game Arcade for Cats is designed for feline fun!\r\n\r\n  It contains six different flavours of games that cycle through to provide your cat with non-stop entertainment.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMC7V","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"KubiTarock","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.407.9007199266440007.77031caf-c163-4e14-9817-02847b06ee37.956aa47f-cb58-43f1-a762-84e19b625521","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#005A00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40808.9007199266440007.90ff4399-d629-4a18-b447-e2d90f0a3ac1.822f49ae-82eb-4a08-9511-5cee291d58f4","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#005A00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44650.9007199266440007.75a0d50a-3896-4c98-a96f-a95e304eb7ba.ecbd74a1-6a16-4359-a37a-08eda95b603f","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#005A00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57811.9007199266440007.a422667b-7cb3-408b-b459-8cc325a5b9e7.fcf8455e-5add-4a56-bef0-d9ee456ed8f9","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#005A00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33003.9007199266440007.dd691f33-c726-497d-9a2f-8605b39d93d0.f28f3c38-012f-4932-94ea-4681c254e460","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#005A00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7678.9007199266440007.9f694290-f71b-4127-a092-c6cb013e91a5.0de7d6e0-f30d-45f1-9869-0f7d8363fb39","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#005A00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.2537.9007199266440007.f2d890c8-db55-4c2b-b0af-18889ad415e0.43553583-0f02-44e7-9ed9-c9d89e3a9619","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#005A00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$22.45⁺","Price":22.45,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["11798KubiConsult.KubiTarock_71t3s60kmf8kc"],"ContentIds":["49716d71-75f4-aefb-eb2d-98b46b249a3c","ef74662d-777e-07df-f4a6-993623de69e8"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"KubiTarock is a card game for four players. It is based on the popular Austrian Tarock - also known as \"Königsrufen (King Calling)\".\r\n\r\nThe complete deck contains 54 cards, 32 color suit cards and 22 tarock cards. The color suits are: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades. The tarock cards are labeled by roman numerals from I, II, III, ... to XXII and function in the game as a permanent suit of trumps. The playing order is counter-clockwise. The game starts with an auction process: The player with the highest bidding becomes the game declarer. There are positive games and negative games: In a positive game, the declarer must achieve a minimum number of points to win. In a negative game, the declarer must achieve the announced number of tricks (0 to 2) exactly. Basically, in all games, players have to follow suit. In negative games additionally, each player must overtrump if possible. Because there are special games for the forehand player, it never happens that all players pass and no game comes out. See Game Rules for the details.\r\n\r\nThe current version provides five playing modes:\r\n•Offline mode\r\n In this mode, the user controls at least one player. All other players will be controlled by the simulator \"Tarobot\". The simulator by the way sees only those cards the human player would also see. But you, too, can let the \"Tarobot\" support you in playing. If you select the appropriate setting, it marks the action on the user interface that it would perform in your place.\r\n•Learning mode\r\n In the learning mode you can question any action that the \"Tarobot\" simulator proposes for you. He will then tell you the reasons why he thinks the action makes sense. Of course, the Tarobot is not a person who takes into account the psychology of other players. He is a pure numeric, who expresses everything in numbers to evaluate them with his algorithms. But he knows all the rules and can give the beginner important hints when practicing the game.\r\n•Quiz mode\r\n This mode is a variant of the offline mode. In addition to the fun of playing, you can train your memory and thus your playing skills improve. Randomly selected questions about the current card playing state are presented to you during the game. After you have selected the supposedly correct answer, the solution will be presented to you immediately. Depending on the question you will get different number of points for the correct or also for an almost correct solution. In the quiz statistics you can read the development of your success in a calendar. If you have reached a minimum number of points and a minimum success rate, you will also receive symbolic awards such as flower pot, medal, and cup.\r\n•Online mode\r\n In this mode, up to 4 owners of a full license can play together online. If less then 4 users are participating in an online session, the remaining players are simulated. In parallel to the playing session, a Skype audio conference should be held, enabling the same conversation between the players as in a real card playing group. Before starting the first session, one of the online users must create a online user group. This user becomes the group administrator, responsible for maintaining the group. The lifespan of the group is limited to 90 days initially. By purchasing an add-on, the lifespan can be extended by 365 days per purchase. Online games are subject to charge. The full license already includes 25 payed online games. By purchasing an add-on, the contingent of payed online games can be increased by 100 or 500 games per purchase respectively.\r\n•Autonomous mode\r\n In this mode, the application plays completely independently without user participation. Of course, this is primarily intended for testing. But it can also be fun to watch.\r\n\r\nThe user interface shows a gaming table in the middle where the players can place their cards. On the four sides of the table, the four players are located showing the hand cards, the tricks pile and other details. Only the hand cards of the user-controlled players are shown face-up. All other hands are showing the cards facedown. You - the current Windows user, must control at least one player.\r\n\r\nIn an offline session, you can undo and redo all actions of the game. You may also utilize assistance from \"Tarobot\" while playing. For replaying games, you can allocate a game archive. The archived games can be reopened and automatically replayed to any situation of interest. Experts may even build their very own games based on an existing game by using the edit mode. In this mode, cards can be exchanged freely between the players and between players and the Talon.\r\n\r\nIn an online session, you can play Tarock with your friends wherever they may be. Most of the manipulation and assistance functions of the offline mode are disabled in this case. Even though, the group administrator can enable and disable some them, such as \"undo\", with mutual consent even during a session.\r\n\r\nMultiple settings options allow you to change game parameters and appearance. You may select another color theme or another card face or card back design for example. You even may insert your favorite photo in one of the card backs containing a special photo frame. You can also activate speech output. Then, for example, you will hear the announcements of the simulated players and you do not have to pay so much attention to the screen display.\r\n\r\nIn the comprehensive online-help, you can find a detailed description of the game rules and of the user interface. It also describes how to perform each of the playing tasks.\r\n\r\nKubiTarock is designed for the Universal Windows Platform. You can install and use the app on all devices powered by Windows 10. The user interface adapts itself to the current device capabilities.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMHT1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Jane's Zoo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27496.9007199266452308.06e9dae3-6857-408f-ad3e-597423f8bb50.d59a6565-6c8e-4adb-8ada-b675c493d955","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#92de36","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65484.9007199266452308.0d401cee-68ec-46b6-9396-78ef9d3831a1.71560c7d-9744-40e3-8d51-ffd5f8309eb7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#92de36","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$5.25","Price":5.25,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["780F5C7B.JanesZoo_0gmyx1dmsk3dw"],"ContentIds":["2180952f-8e65-9c2a-26e6-d483646f8cf4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Feel the spirit of freedom and plunge yourself into the world of wild nature!

solving the different random mathematical exercises proposed. To do this, you have at your disposal a water hose, with which you must water the numbers and the appropriate solutions. All this in a safe environment to learn mathematics in a fun and enjoyable way. It's also the kids version of Math Combat Challenge.\r\n\r\nMath Classroom Challenge is designed for children over the age of four. In the game the player can do several activities: learn the numbers that fly, learn how to throw the water, solve the static panels looking for the corresponding numbers, and solve the dynamic panels that appear suddenly with three solutions. Always throwing the water from the hose to the correct solution.\r\n\r\nIn the game the player never loses.

Start building your transport empire by creating bus routes between as many cites as possible. You can freely build the road network and create traffic lights in order to have a better control of your traffic. \r\n\r\nThe player's company is responsible for connecting service centers to  gas stations and connecting these to other cities. This will facilitate the transportation of passengers on the buses, as the buses require fuel and servicing. Purchase a variety of bus models, based on their fuel type and consumption. Update your gas station's fuel supply to unlock newer bus models. Each bus route can accommodate a maximum of eight connections. You can build up to 30 bus stations and vehicles per game. At any time, you can upgrade your bus stations, in order to accommodate more passengers. Moreover, you can sell used vehicles to buy new and even more advanced ones.\r\n \r\nYour vehicles fuel up automatically if a road connection is available to the central gas station. But, at some point your vehicles will have to be serviced.

Train Corporation is a great chance to experience that kind of life!  \r\n  \r\nYou will have an opportunity to choose the region, where the first railways will be laid, and to prioritize further construction activity. Remember that the cost of the road construction depends on the distance between cities, while the profitability depends on the demand for this direction.  \r\n  \r\n- Set the rates based on the congestion of each line.  \r\n- Increase the passenger traffic through the construction of the parallel tunnels on each line.   \r\n- Enhance the comfort and wagon capacity, increase the reliability and speed of the train.  \r\n  \r\nEstimate your opportunities: road maintenance involves daily expenses. In addition, you need to have money for the unscheduled repair of trains and railways in case of emergency. If the corporation goes bankrupt due to your fault, you will be in trouble. And you want to stay out of jail, don’t you?  \r\n  \r\nBut let's look on the bright side. While engaged in the venture projects development, you need to believe in its future success.

The game is safe for all ages but comes without all the distractions that games for kids usually have. Anyone with a taste for puzzle and mind games should give A Game of Lines and Nodes a try. The game does not require any special permissions in your device, works offline and has no ads.\r\n\r\nThe game involves playing with lines and dots (we call them nodes) but is far from being a simple connect-the-dots game. A Game of Lines and Nodes combines elements of Hashi or Hashiwokakero (橋をかけろ, literally translated to “build bridges!”), plus some features that make it unique, engaging and relaxing.\r\n\r\nThe game is somewhat similar to Hashi in that the nodes have a required number of connections and in that lines cannot jump over nodes or other lines. However, nodes here are 'floating' and can be dragged around freely. Also, there can only be one connection between the same two nodes, unlike Hashi where there can be up to two.\r\n\r\nAs the nodes get connected, polygons and figures takes form, helping you to determine if you are in the right track to solve the puzzle. Just watching nodes react to each other as they are dragged around contributes to the relaxed environment and is quite entertaining.\r\n\r\nThere are no timers in this game, or any other element or mechanic that will make you feel rushed or under pressure. You can take as long as you like to complete a level, you can even save the state of a puzzle and complete it in more than one play sessions.\r\n\r\nA Game of Lines and Nodes is designed to be as hard or as easy as you want it to be. You can test your might by playing a level without any help and you may succeed, specially after you are more experienced. However, help is always available if you choose to use it.\r\n\r\nThere are no ads, no subscriptions and no in-app purchases. Also, the game is safe for all ages and  the simple interface and controls will appeal to both young and mature audiences.\r\n\r\nThe game can be played in English, Spanish or Chinese (中文) and the language can be changed at any time from the Welcome screen. \r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n  • Easy to learn and play but challenging\r\n  • Relaxed no-rush environment\r\n  • No ads, no subscriptions, and no in-app purchases\r\n  • No internet connection needed to play\r\n  • Does not require special permissions in your device\r\n  • Safe for all ages\r\n  • Clean and minimalist user interface\r\n  • Option to pause and continue later\r\n  • Original game elements like unbreakable connections, incompatible nodes and more\r\n  • Almost impossible to get stuck in a level with the help system\r\n  • Over 50 challenging levels\r\n  • Background selection and an option to mute sounds\r\n  • Can be played in English, Spanish or Chinese (中文)","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

addictive hidden object game about daily chores!\r\n\r\nFind and spot the given hidden objects!\r\n\r\nBeing a full time mom and a housewife may seem easy for some people. When women go to work, they spend about eight hours there, and after that they have the same responsibilities at home and sometimes a quick lunch or a take away meal could do its job. However, people usually are not that tolerant for the moms that don't go at work. Since they are at home, everything is supposed to be in a biggest order. The house should be perfectly clean, the lunch should be always ready on time, the children should be always satisfied and same goes for the husband. That means a lot of work but when a person says that she was at home all day, it seems that she takes a lot of rest, that she has a lot of time for herself, but how could that person have time for herself when she is always taking care for someone else?!\r\n\r\nThis commitment is usually a pleasure but let's not forget that every mom needs some time for herself, some time to spend with her friends, time to do something just for her, to work on herself...\r\n\r\nDoris for example is a wife and mother of two. She has many everyday responsibilities and she starts each day same. She insists on finishing those responsibilities while her husband and children are out, so she could have some quality time with them when they are at home.

Like some people explain, it is hard to beat the twisty, cobbled lanes of Prague's Mala Strana district. At this place, sonatas spread out of palace windows and quiet baroque gardens show up behind great grandiose gates. The fact that the city's centuries-old architecture has been hardly scratched during the Second World War, makes it an appropriate setting to a way of life that gave us the term Bohemian.\r\n\r\nAshley is a journalist in one New York magazine that searches for the most romantic places in the world. She has never been to Prague, but according to what she read and hear about it, it could definitely be one of the most romantic cities in the world. However, she used to make her columns based on facts and that's why she asks her editor to allow her a trip to Prague. She would like to take a closer look at the city and then write her own column about it. She is quite prepared and knows which places should she visit, but also she will find something at the place as well.\r\n\r\nAshley's editor was kind enough so she gave her the opportunity to visit Prague. At the moment she is in Prague where she starts her romantic journey. Through her search we will also see the most beautiful places in Prague and enjoy this bohemian city.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NW0GKR8ZCCR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Karts Race VR","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33078.14459375449149666.06f48103-3ccf-42e6-b9c4-2c832acb6ca1.5cbdfc46-a5a5-4c26-b561-270f39bb6e5b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16838.14459375449149666.06f48103-3ccf-42e6-b9c4-2c832acb6ca1.4b08d582-62f4-4e9f-98a4-390eeda7fbf9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49652.14459375449149666.06f48103-3ccf-42e6-b9c4-2c832acb6ca1.6c344c83-8de4-474f-9e30-1f8afeacb127","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58109.14459375449149666.06f48103-3ccf-42e6-b9c4-2c832acb6ca1.d69f5791-2672-4f0f-bfd6-5fcdf5df8043","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"AU$7.45","DisplayPrice":"AU$2.95","Price":2.95,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["35915NetDinamica.KartsRaceVR_psb83shwtv3sw"],"ContentIds":["6f59c006-cfb3-f421-20a6-b6d826476eaf","06490496-7a54-5961-f9b2-d8d65722b875"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"SAVE AU$4.50","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Feel the sensation of three different racing environment. \r\nGet in the driver's seat and race with you kart. \r\n\r\nThree different environments \r\n-Farm, racing at farm, trees, corn, lots to see and feel. \r\n-Fantasy, beautiful environment with giants mushroom, trees, bleachers and more. \r\n-Desert Dunes, running and going up and down between the dunes, this a exciting race. \r\n\r\nYou can play and driver the car with the touch controllers. \r\nFull customization for your race, pilot, music and level of challenge This is fun for everybody. \r\nLets race and have lots of fun!\r\n\r\nThis app requires Windows Mixed Reality Headset and Touch Controllers\r\nWarning VR app maybe cause motion sickness\r\n\r\nNew levels going to be add very soon!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NW4KM0KCG96","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Piano Play 3D -

It changes due to the person's actions and affects his/her rights and liberties. Citizens with higher rating have more benefits, and zero rating means forced liquidation of the person.\r\n\r\nBecause of a technical error you have received a rating that was even below zero: -0.01. Theoretically, this is simply impossible, and now you \"do not exist\": electronic devices do not identify you, officials and public services refuse to deal with you because of a system error. Now you can't even buy food or pay for treatment.\r\n\r\nTrying to obtain justice is useless, and the only way out is to hack the government server where the rating base of citizens is stored and edit the data on it. It's very difficult because the server is controlled by a quantum computer, and huge processing power is needed to overcome the quantum encryption. Your home computer is definitely unable to do this, so you need something more powerful.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Expand and develop a network of computers, decide when it is powerful enough to crack the quantum server;\r\n- Use the power of your network to mine cryptocurrency, earning funds for further upgrades and improvements;\r\n- Beware of the police and Cyber Control that can track down your suspicious activity and confiscate (or even burn) your equipment;\r\n- As the story goes, it becomes even more complicated: you thought that its only your own fate that depends on your actions, but it suddenly turns out that everything is more global...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NW98XZKHJRV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pinball FX3 - Marvel Pinball: Cinematic Pack","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12819.14449228946069475.1152921504739289881.a1ac47e0-4d67-42d6-abf1-f01b43af0317","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37868.14449228946069475.1152921504739289729.fdcf0dc8-d58c-481a-adad-bc382403b25f","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$14.95","Price":14.95,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":[""],"ContentIds":[],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Tables inspired by blockbuster films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe come together in this thrilling pack featuring \"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy\", \"Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron\" and \"Marvel's Ant-Man.\"\r\n\r\n- An unlikely band of ragtag outsiders and misfits, led by the interstellar adventurer Star-Lord join forces to form the Guardians of the Galaxy.
